# Phase 4 Syllabus: Flex Program, 60 Week Pace

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to Phase 4! This is the last phase of new material to learn before the
end of the program, so strap in. You'll be building on the concepts from the
previous phase and learning how to use a powerful framework, Rails, to build
more complex backends.

By the end of the phase, you will be able to:

- Create RESTful APIs
- Validate data
- Build authentication into APIs
- Deploy backend applications
- Share data between a frontend JavaScript application and a backend API application

Use the schedule below to make sure you're working through the material at
the right pace. The lessons marked with a ⭐️ are **milestones** that are useful
to check your understanding of the material you've learned. If you feel you're
falling behind, make sure to communicate with your instructor.

## Week 37 - 39

To get started, you'll be learning the fundamentals of Rails and how to organize
your backend code to build out features quickly. You'll also learn some
conventions, like REST, that are common in the world of API development.

**Total Assignments: (23)**

- Phase 4 Overview (1)
- Rails Fundamentals (11)
  - ⭐️ Rails Fundamentals Quiz
- CRUD with Rails (11)
  - ⭐️ Putting it All Together: Rails CRUD
- Validations (5)
  - ⭐️ Validations Quiz

## Week 40 - 42

Once you've gained some familiarity with Rails, it's time to start adding some
more complexity. You learn some best practices for communicating between the
frontend and the backend. You'll also learn how to work with more complex
domains involving multiple related models, and how to structure the response
from the server to make it easier to work with on the frontend.

**Total Assignments: (23)**

- Client-Server Communication (5)
  - ⭐️ Putting it All Together: Client-Server Communication
- Active Record Associations (8)
  - ⭐️ Active Record Associations Quiz
- Serialization (4)
  - ⭐️ Serialization Quiz
- Additional Practice (1)
  - ⭐️ Rails Mock Challenge - Camping Fun

## Week 43 - 45

The last key concepts from this phase are learning how to **authenticate** and
**authorize** users in your application, and how to **deploy** your application
for the world to see! You'll learn some more of the core technology that makes
the web work, like cookies, and best practices for working with sensitive data
like passwords. You'll also learn how hosting services like Heroku can be used
to deploy your application.

**Note**: If you're moving through this material quickly and want an extra
challenge, there are also optional lessons on Redux, which is a state management
tool for React. Redux is beneficial for larger applications, so you may want to
work on these lessons prior to Phase 5 if you're interested in using Redux in
your final project.

**Total Assignments: (15)**

- Auth (11)
  - ⭐️ Putting it All Together: Auth
- Deploying (4)
  - ⭐️ Deploying Quiz

## Week 46 - 48

It's time for the last project before your capstone! Use this project to
solidify your understanding of Rails, and build something you can refer back to
when you're working on your final project next phase. This is a good time to
make sure you have a solid grasp of what it takes to put together a full-stack
application from scratch with a Rails backend and a React frontend, since you'll
be using that same stack for your final project.

Details for the project can be found in the Milestones module.
